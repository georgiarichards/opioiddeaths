# Opioid-related Prevention of Future Deaths reports (PFDs)

This is a juypter notebook used to scrape all case information from the [Courts & Tribunial Judiciary website](https://www.judiciary.uk/subject/prevention-of-future-deaths/). We are scraping this website for a study that will systematically analyse PFDs in which an opioid was implicated in a death, and the responses to them. 

We have created the [Preventable Deaths Database and Tracker](https://preventabledeathstracker.net/) using this website scrape. Our other Github repository for this project is [here](https://github.com/georgiarichards/georgiarichards.github.io).
